      "Carter was the best player on a defensive line that featured three 2022 first-round picks, including the first overall selection. Unlike a lot of defensive tackles who have a specialty, the Florida native is about as versatile as they come. He's quick and athletic to make offensive linemen miss as a run defender and has plenty of strength to hold up against and shed one-on-one blocks. As a pass-rusher, he can win with power using a bull rush or push-pull move or around the edges with finesse moves.",

      "A true RB1. He has an elite cutting ability paired with home-run speed, resulting in an RB who often creates his own running room, even when running behind a suspect OL. Add to that his top tier receiving ability out of the backfield and you have a dream RB prospect for any team.",

    description:
      "While this class lacks a true X prototype WR1 that other years have had, that does not mean there are not great talents to be found at the position. On top of that list is Zay Flowers, an elite route runner with 4.3 speed and the shiftiness to create a YAC monster. While he won both outside and inside in college, he projects as an elite big play slot WR in the NFL.",
